Analysis
After reviewing cities by latitude, it was observed that cities located between the Tropic of Cancer and Capricorn tend to have the highest daily temperatures.

It can be seen that cities located between 40 and 80 degrees latitude have the largest concentration of humidity levels above 60%. While the humidity levels between 0 to 20 degrees have the greatest range of humidity.

While looking at overall cloud cover it shows that cloud cover is evenly dispersed it is over our planet.

Regarding wind speeds across the cities, it is relatively uncommon to have wind speeds exceed 15 mph.
